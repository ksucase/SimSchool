 Getting Started with GitHub Code Repositories 
 Repositories are common storage areas for teams working on projects together.
 ================================================================================

Create a free account on GitHub (www.github.com). Remember your userID and password.

Install the Native app GitHub for windows from: 
https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git.

Install TortoiseGit from http://code.google.com/p/tortoisegit.

 Make a new subfolder called "SimSchool".
 
 In Windows Explorer, right-click the SimSchool folder and select
 "Git create repository here". Leave the box unchecked and select OK.
 
 This will create a hidden .git folder at the same level as the items 
 listed above.  In that folder is a config file. Use a text editor
 to edit the contents of the .git / config file as shown below.
 
 Right-click on the SimSchool folder and select "Tortoise Git" / Pull".
 
 Provide your userID and password as requested.
 
 This will download the contents of the SimSchool repository at 
 https://github.com/ksucase/SimSchool into your folder. 
 
 Double-click on the SimSchool.sln file to open the Solution in Visual Studio.
 
 
 ================================================================================
 Edit the hidden .git / config  to match the following
 ================================================================================
[core]
	repositoryformatversion = 0
	filemode = false
	bare = false
	logallrefupdates = true
	symlinks = false
	ignorecase = true
	hideDotFiles = dotGitOnly
[remote "origin"]
	url = https://github.com/ksucase/SimSchool.git
	fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*
	puttykeyfile = 
[branch "master"]
	remote = origin
	merge = refs/heads/master
